TeleTeachingTool - Version History
----------------------------------
by Peter Ziewer - http://ttt.in.tum.de
  
Bugs and known issues:
known: flash uses thumbnails without annotations
bug: flash: annotations are not deleted if skipping backwards within same index/clip
bug: flash converter: last thumb is missing after splitting indices due to 16000 frame limit
bug: volume monitor of recorder blocks playback (Linux only?)
bug: audio recording may fail whenever recording, playing and recording again (observed for Linux with JMF2.1.1a)
bug: unstable fullscreen mode under MS Windows

TODO: notifier pop-up if recorder has not been startet (to inform teacher) (loopback recorder only)
TODO: improve Flash startup under Windows (displays while opening under Windows - slow!!!!!!! - add preload)
TODO: autodetection for cursor support 
	SHAPE+POS is ok and No SHAPE and No POS is ok
	SHAPE but No POS is BAD!!!
	if shape comes but no pos message, disable shape encoding.
TODO: set recording folder per lecture profile
TODO: check for mp3 support at startup (about dialog) 
TODO: break infinite reconnect loop if VNC Server is not available
TODO: handle change of desktop resolution or auto close (currently only showing warning message)


TODO add %CLASSPATH% to ttt.bat path

------------------------------


fixed Flash export for recordings with many messages by lowering the framerate (caused blank Flash video)
fixed Flash handling errors caused by resolution change during recording


Version 20.08.2008

released under GNU General Puplic License (GPL) 
added support for OmniPage 16 (reading of xml searchbase files)
fixed filenames of ocr input to support recordings with more than 99 indices
fixed encoding problems for special characters like umlauts in title and searchbase (caused unreadable recordings)
fixed remote call to update online searchbase during publishing
fixed bug in Lecture Profiling Dialog (when selecting new remote server)
fixed visibility of dialogs in fullscreen mode (leave fullscreen mode before displaying)
fixed key input issues and focus handling for java 6
fixed skipping of unknown message types
fixed server connection handling if server is unreachable - set timeout to 20 sec (default was 3 min)
fixed handling of VNC Server resolution changes - show NOT SUPPORTED message 
improved post processing performance for thumbnails and flash about 10-30%
cleaned source code (removed some unused code)


Version 19.02.2008

fixed video monitor and recorder under Windows
fixed window size


Version 28.11.2007

added audio and video preview
updated lecture profiling dialog
added linear sync during replay whenever audio recording is shorter than desktop recording
added controls for linear sync and manual adjustment
added linear audio support (WAV)
added updating online searchbase via remote call command execution
fixed flash conversion (edited recordings may have caused doupled audio playback)
fixed auto-filenaming for lecture names containing "-"


Version 14.06.2007

fixed underlining of search results (reading of OmniPage 14 xml searchbase files)
	note: Version 06.06.2007 and 11.06.2007 may have stored ttt-files with incorrect searchbases - re-integrate searchbase via Post Processing Dialog


Version 11.06.2007

fixed recursive copy for lecture publishing (for copying html folder)


Version 06.06.2007

improved flash conversion (new GUI, combining updates to handle recordings with a large number of messages)
added lecture publishing (via ssh/sft)
added loopback recorder (without displaying recorded desktop - typically for MS Windows systems)
added support for OmniPage 15 (reading of xml searchbase files)
changed default color depth to 16 bit (instead of 24 bit)
fixed handling of mpeg audio layer 2 file with ending .mp2 instead of .mp3
fixed key handling in teacher mode (control keys F9-F12 are no longer sent to vnc server)
fixed underlining of search results (failed if first index had no searchable text)
fixed pdf script generator (support resolutions up to 1024x768)
fixed html script generator (fixed slash/backslash issues under MS Windows)
fixed pen width for drawing annotations to scripts
fixed maximum sizes of internal windows
fixed index computation for annotated whiteboard pages
fixed annotations at thumbnails (reworked annotation selection)
